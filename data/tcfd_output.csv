Does the company describe its processes for identifying and/or assessing climate-related risks?,"This is seen as the first line of defence and involves a technical asset-by-asset review of the portfolio to assess asset-specific climate change risks and options to build resilience. These reviews go beyond basic carbon foot-printing to assessing exposures to plausible climatic events, supply chains, policy or technological change and public activism. The reviews are conducted by First State Super in collaboration with its asset managers and advisors over a two-year cycle. A key part of First State Super’s ESG Policy is proactive engagement with senior executives and boards of the companies we hold, even where our percentage of share-holdings is small, e.g. listed shares. Moreover, when many pension funds divest en masse, this can increase the cost of capital for new projects, and may have real signalling effects that change corporate attitudes. First State Super has prepared this paper to share with other investors how we are thinking about climate change and how we are responding to the very significant and multi-dimensional risks climate change presents. We firmly believe that large institutional investors not only have a fiduciary responsibility to manage these risks, but through shared insights and action, can actually support more sustainable returns to portfolios over time.",Risk Management a)

Olam has implemented a rigorous risk management framework that identifies and assesses the likelihood and impact of risks, and the actions needed to mitigate the impact across the entire business. Every year we assess the risks that could impact achievement of our strategic objectives at a consolidated level (top-down approach) and on a segment level (bottom-up approach). Among the key risks that escalated in 2019 – and our efforts to mitigate them – include: Agricultural Risk: as climate change becomes more prominent, its impact on agriculture will increase in the future. Many of the 50 risks which are tracked concern agricultural risks e.g. yield risk, and mitigation measures are being put in place accordingly such as drip irrigation on our palm plantation in Gabon. As well as working with farmers on mitigation and adaptation measures, we are exploring other ways to measure climate risk, e.g. climate VaR.

The steel industry is one of the highest CO2 emitting industries, accounting for 7% of CO2 emissions globally. Already before a solution for fossil-free steel making is in place, SSAB aims to cut its joint carbon dioxide emissions in Sweden by 25% by as early as 2025, through conversion of the blast furnace in Oxelösund, Sweden. Between 2030–2040, the aim is convert also the blast furnaces in Luleå, Sweden and Raahe, Finland to eliminate most of the remaining CO2 emissions and to attain the target of being fossil-free by 2045. To be able to carry out this project, however, significant national contributions are still required from the state, research institutions and universities. SSAB has set an energy savings target to reduce the use of purchased energy by 400 GWh by the end of 2020. By the end of 2017, SSAB achieved approximately 304 GWh (1,094 TJ) or 76% of this target. SSAB’s ability to continue to maintain and grow its business as well as provide high-quality products to customers depends, to a large extent, on the contributions of its management and key personnel.",Strategy b)
